# About #

BulletD is a project to create a D binding for the Bullet Physics engine.

# Project status #

Only a very small subset of the Bullet API is bound, and the binding mechanism still has a few rough edges, but what's there kind of works.

# Supported platforms #

Currently, only Linux is supported, but the code might also work on other Unix-like systems. There is currently no Windows support because linking tends to get hairy with DMD involved.
